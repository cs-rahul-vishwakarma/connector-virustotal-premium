#### What's Fixed

- Health Check status renders successful when a random url is passed as API key.
- Removed the keys "tlsh, magic & vhash" from the variable "field_mapping" defined in the last step "Return Output Data"
  in the Pluggable Enrichment Playbook of the FileHash Indicator which fails for specific file hashes.
